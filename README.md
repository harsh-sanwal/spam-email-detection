# spam-email-detection
**Spam Email Detection using Logistic Regression** is a machine learning project that classifies emails as either “spam” or “not spam” based on their content. It uses logistic regression, a statistical model that predicts the probability of an email belonging to the spam category. The process involves collecting and preprocessing email data, extracting features such as word frequency or presence of certain keywords, and then training the model on labeled datasets. Once trained, the model can analyze new emails and determine their likelihood of being spam. This project showcases skills in text preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning.
